- Merge pull request #107 from antonio59/cursor/google-site-verification-meta-aed0

Fix nested Google site verification meta tag
- Remove unused verification helper test file

Fallow flags unimported *.test.ts as dead code, and this repo has no
test runner in CI.

Co-authored-by: Antonio Smith <antonio59@users.noreply.github.com>
- Normalize Google site verification env to a bare token

Peel nested content="..." / &quot; snippets so a pasted <meta> tag
cannot be emitted as the verification content attribute.

- Merge pull request #106 from antonio59/cursor/charger-photo-alert-guide-9768

Add charger photo alert prevention guide

- Bump astro in the astro group across 1 directory (#100)
- Bump @types/react-dom in the react group across 1 directory (#101)
- Bump convex from 1.44.0 to 1.45.0 in the convex group (#102)
- Bump resend from 6.21.0 to 6.24.0 (#104)
- Bump @astrojs/netlify in the dev-dependencies group (#103)
- Bump resend from 6.20.0 to 6.21.0 (#98)
- Bump nanostores from 1.5.1 to 1.5.2 (#97)
- Bump tailwindcss from 4.3.1 to 4.3.3 in the tailwind group (#96)
- Make directory creates idempotent at the Convex layer

- New insertDirectoryRowIfAbsent in convex/lib/crud.ts: inside the
  mutation (transactional, race-safe) it matches an existing row by
  normalized name or website host, fills only missing optional fields,
  and never inserts a duplicate. Returns { id, created }
- banks.create and mobileProviders.create now use it
- directory-discovery normalizeName strips generic suffixes
  (mobile/bank/building/society/uk) so 'Lebara' and 'Lebara Mobile'
  resolve to the same key, matching the Convex-side rule
- Verified against prod: creating 'Barclays Bank' returned
  { created: false } with no row count change
- Remove duplicate directory entries, fix stale bank count in FAQ schema

- Deduped Convex directories: 28 banks and 9 providers were seeded twice
  (exact name matches), plus a sparser duplicate Lebara record removed;
  banks now 58 active, providers 26
- Added scripts/dedupe-directories.mjs (dry-run by default, --apply to
  delete) so this can be re-run safely
- banks.astro FAQ schema said 'over 25 UK banks'; now 'over 55'
- Stop verification cron from deactivating live directories on bot-blocks

The first run hid Revolut, TSB, Lebara and others because their WAFs
answered 403 to the bot User-Agent. Now any HTTP response counts as
alive, the UA looks like a real browser, network-level failures are
flagged for manual review instead of auto-deactivating, and the report
email reflects the new 'needs review' semantics.
- Fix build failures and dead-code check

- news/[slug].astro and emergency.astro each had a duplicate closing
  </div> breaking the Astro compiler on CI
- [location].astro: use hotspotRank() from the shared hotspot dataset
  (fixes Fallow unused-export failure)
- slides/[id].astro: opt dynamic route into prerender explicitly for
  output: 'server'
- Address the August site audit: syndication cap, city ranks, map escaping, legal pages, safety slides (#99)

Co-authored-by: Antonio Smith <antoniojosephsmith18@gmail.com>
- Redesign directory entries as index rows and call tiles
- Restructure FAQ around the post-theft visitor journey

- Categories reordered: 'My Phone Was Just Stolen' first, then Reporting
  to Police, Blocking Your SIM & Number, Recovery & Insurance, and
  Protecting Your Next Phone last
- Category headers drop decorative icon chips for plain typography
- Fix pill filter JS bug: inactive pills were set to bg-foreground
  (black) instead of bg-neutral-100, and active used text-background
  instead of text-primary-foreground
- Hero simplified with a 'start with the first section' pointer; 'contact
  us' is now 'contact me'
- Restructure About page, single-line directory names

- About: reorganised around five visitor questions (what is it, why it
  exists, what can I do here, why trust it, how can I help); hero now
  one-sentence mission plus a single emergency CTA; stats consolidated
  into one headline figure plus a compact strip; data sources and values
  merged into one 'Why Trust It' section with a 'Built differently'
  panel absorbing the repeated free/privacy/no-ads messages; closing CTA
  card trio removed
- banks/mobile-providers: names sit on their own line at a smaller
  responsive size so they fit on one line without wrapping or
  truncating; Website link moved to the tag row
- Denser directory grids, calmer contact blocks, first-person Ko-fi

- banks/mobile-providers: auto-fill minmax(280px,1fr) grid (1-4 cols),
  20px padding, equal-height cards with contact block anchored to the
  bottom via mt-auto, names wrap instead of truncating
- Emergency contact block now reads as information: light tinted surface
  with a red left accent border, dark 20px tabular-nums tel: number,
  muted uppercase label, availability and abroad number on one compact
  secondary line. Identical treatment on both directories
- Footer: 'Support us' Ko-fi button renamed 'Buy me a coffee'
- Fix theft-methods dark card, redesign directory cards, schedule monthly verification

- the-problem: orange method card used bg-foreground, hiding title and
  description (dark-on-dark); now matches other cards
- Tip pills: icon and text align properly when the tip wraps
- banks/mobile-providers: drop coloured letter avatars, cleaner name +
  tag + website rows
- Add scheduled-verify-directory Netlify function (monthly, 1st, 07:17
  UTC) calling /api/cron/verify-directory so Last verified dates refresh
- Round header emergency button; rename About Us to About

Site voice is first-person (solo maintainer), so the footer and search
index now say About instead of About Us.
- Fix stretched icon bar in security checkup hero on mobile
- Fix mobile menu trapped inside blurred header

The sticky header's backdrop-blur creates a containing block for fixed
descendants, so the slide-out menu and backdrop were sized to the 51px
header instead of the viewport. Render them as siblings of the header.
- Fix hero layout and mobile header overflow

- Remove UK Theft Crisis badge; vertically centre hero content
- Hero image now sizes via aspect ratio at all breakpoints (was collapsing
  to a thin strip on mobile due to over-constrained absolute sizing)
- Evidence strip wraps naturally instead of truncating the sources link
- Header: burger menu now appears at tablet widths (768-1023 had no nav),
  wordmark shrinks/truncates, theme toggle hides below 400px so the
  burger never overflows the viewport edge
- Round off harsh square cards and buttons across key pages

- Home: round Share-a-stat cards, scenarios/statistics CTA banners, count box
- News: category filters to pills, round RSS button and state boxes
- Community: compact buttons to rounded-lg per DESIGN.md
- Footer: round outline Support button
- Restyle OG share images with cinematic London hero backdrop
- Drop orphaned hero video assets
- Replace flat hero animation with cinematic London street image

- Generated 2K cinematic dusk scene, cropped watermark, optimized to 164KB JPG
- Removed hero video, autoplay script, and stale VideoObject schema
- Softened overlay gradient, tightened evidence strip to one line
- Reduced mobile hero min-height; moved orphaned videos out of public/
- Fix remaining low-contrast text on dark/red backgrounds

- banks: emergency contact box uses destructive-foreground throughout
- admin theft-reports: inactive filter pills keep light styling on toggle
- Fix unreadable community insight cards (dark-on-red/dark-on-ink tokens)
- Remove stale uuid override/resolution (dep no longer in tree; fixes Fallow CI)
- Fix null-rank badge on no-data locations, tidy hero separators, correct chart footnote
- Slim hero to tagline + CTAs + one-line evidence strip; add backup guide

- Hero stat cards duplicated AnimatedStats below the fold; replaced with
  a compact sourced stat line linking to /statistics
- Prevention guide: new 'Back Up Your Device' section (iCloud/Google
  steps, storage limits, monthly verification reminder)
- Sourced borough hotspots, about-page stats; drop unpatchable vulns; remove one-off scripts

- Hotspot lists on statistics + the-problem now use police.uk figures
  (12 months to Jun 2026, ~1mi of borough centre); Southwark enters top 5
- About page: replaced unsourced stats with Met FOI / Met / ONS / CSEW figures
- pnpm overrides: @netlify/blobs@^11, @netlify/dev-utils@^6,
  @netlify/functions-dev@^2 - clears 2 of 3 Dependabot highs (image-size);
  extract-zip remains, no upstream patch, dev-only, documented in auditConfig
- Removed applied codemods and one-off fix/cleanup scripts
- Sourced city data, OG refresh, sources block, em-dash purge

- OG images regenerated with 'every seven minutes' tagline
- City comparison + location pages: real police.uk figures
  (Jul 2025-Jun 2026, theft-from-person within ~1mi of centre);
  Manchester/Edinburgh/Glasgow marked 'not published' (GMP/Police
  Scotland do not feed police.uk street data)
- statistics page: Sources & methodology block with links to Met FOI,
  Met press releases, ONS bulletins, police.uk API
- Removed unused api/admin/seed-stats endpoint (generated synthetic data)
- Purged em/en dashes from user-facing copy and outbound templates
- Retag to 'every seven minutes', add 2019-2025 trend chart

- Tagline now reflects 2025 Met rate (71,391 thefts, one every ~7.4 min)
- statistics page: year-by-year bar chart, Met FOI series 2019-2024
  plus 2025 headline series with comparability footnote
- Updated H1, meta descriptions, OG/Twitter alt text, badges
- Update theft stats to sourced 2024-2026 figures, trim hero copy

- Hero: 117,211 London thefts 2024 (Met FOI), -12.3% fall in 2025 (Met),
  248 arrests in 4-week blitz (Met, Jan-Feb 2026); drop unsourced 150%/0.8%
- Remove hero paragraph; H1 + CTAs + stats grid only
- statistics/the-problem/location/faq: year-labeled, sourced figures;
  soften unsourced recovery-rate claims
- AnimatedStats: match new sourced numbers
- Fix mobile UX sweep: lucide icon classes, contrast, spacing, excerpts

- Codemod: class -> className for lucide-react icons across 23 .astro files (213 icons were rendering unstyled at default 24px, breaking layout and positioning, e.g. detached search icons).
- mobile-providers: emergency contact box used solid bg-destructive with dark red text (unreadable) -> bg-destructive-subtle.
- banks/theft-map: restore spaces eaten before inline links ('ouremergency guide', 'byreporting').
- news: strip title prefix duplicated inside scraped excerpts (incl. source-suffix variants).
- home: shorten key-stats disclosure summary to avoid mid-phrase wrap.
- Add square 1080x1080 OG share card for 1:1 crop contexts

convert-og-image.mjs now renders both wide and square variants; Layout emits both as og:image alternates.
- Redesign OG image and logo lockup, refresh meta descriptions to new tagline

og-image + logo.svg/png now match the editorial ink/paper/alert-red system; default description, schema.org org logo, manifest, and og/twitter image alt text updated. Hero stats collapse behind a disclosure on mobile.
- Fix mobile hero readability and compact mobile buttons

Hero video becomes a cover background behind flowing content on mobile (no more cramped 4:5 overlay), scrim strengthened. touch-target min drops 44px to 40px (still above WCAG 2.2 AA 24px); hero, checkup, news CTAs get compact px-4 py-2 on small screens.
- Wire orphaned color tokens into DESIGN.md component specs
- Darken warning amber to #9A4F00 for WCAG AA contrast

- Optimize hero video and harden playback
- Pair inverting surfaces with semantic foreground tokens
- Sync DESIGN.md with editorial system and restore radii
- Quieter desktop nav and a text-forward news index
- Fix Fallow dead-code job: declare production deps correctly

Fallow's dead-code check fails with --fail-on-issues on three
dev-dep-in-prod findings: tailwindcss and @tailwindcss/typography are
imported by src/styles/global.css, and @resvg/resvg-js by
scripts/convert-og-image.mjs, yet all three sat in devDependencies.
Pre-existing failure, not introduced by the redesign.

- Fix CI security job: upgrade Astro 7 and patch vulnerable transitive deps

The CI security job (pnpm audit --prod) was failing on 14 production
vulnerabilities. Upgrades astro 6 -> 7, @astrojs/netlify 7 -> 8 and
@astrojs/react 5 -> 6 to clear astro's own advisories, and pins the
remaining vulnerable transitive dependencies (js-yaml, sharp, postcss,
nanoid, svgo, tar, brace-expansion, fast-uri) via pnpm overrides.

Astro 7 requires vite 8, so the vite override moves to ^8.0.13. Tailwind
v4 no longer works through PostCSS under vite 8, so it moves to the
official @tailwindcss/vite plugin and postcss.config.mjs is removed.

Two advisories (image-size, extract-zip) have no published fix upstream
and sit in Netlify dev tooling rather than shipped code; they are listed
in auditConfig.ignoreGhsas with a note to revisit.

30 advisories -> 3, all five CI jobs verified passing locally.

- Remove framer-motion to eliminate 122KB shared bundle chunk

High-impact bundle optimizations for emergency-site performance:

- Refactor HeaderMobile + SiteSearch to use CSS transitions instead of
  framer-motion (removes library from critical path of every page)
- Refactor AnimatedStats, AnimatedNewsSection, AnimatedResources to use
  a lightweight IntersectionObserver hook + CSS keyframe animations
- Add src/hooks/useInView.ts (~400 bytes) as drop-in replacement
- Delete unused PageTransition.tsx and AnimatedHero.tsx
- Remove framer-motion from package dependencies entirely
- Change TheftTrendsChart hydration from client:only/client:load to
  client:visible so Chart.js loads only when scrolled into view

Results:
- Eliminates 122KB raw / ~40KB gzipped shared proxy chunk entirely

  animation library code on initial render
